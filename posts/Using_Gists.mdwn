[Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are Git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable from Git.

### Using Gists

If you find a gist you want to use for yourself for example [this](https://gist.github.com/527113/307c2dec09ceeb647b8fa1d6d49591f3352cb034) gist gives you an easy way to check if a django db table exists.

    git clone https://gist.github.com/527113.git utility
    cd utility && mv gistfile1.py db.py

In your python program you can now use this gist by importing utility.db
