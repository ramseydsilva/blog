This blog is powered by [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) and hosted on github. The reason I chose ikiwiki is because it is lightweight, customizable, and coder friendly. There are two ways to add new posts. One is through its simple and stripped down web interface. The second is via a code editor such as vim. All you need to do is create a new markdown file for your post and run the setup command to publish your new post. It integrates the blogging experience into your beloved code editors (mine is [vim](http://www.vim.org/)). Unlike other blogging softwares that are locked into web browsers, ikiwiki makes blogging possible from your terminal window - making it truly a coders blog.

To install your own ikiwiki blog, follow the installation instructions on ikiwiki's [installation](http://ikiwiki.info/install/) page. Then run the following command to setup your blog:

    ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto-blog.setup
    Successfully set up blog:
	    url:         http://Ubuntu-1210-quantal-64-minimal/~coderfly/blog
	    srcdir:      ~/blog
	    destdir:     ~/public_html/blog
	    repository:  ~/blog.git
    To modify settings, edit ~/blog.setup and then run:
	    ikiwiki -setup ~/blog.setup

See [setup](http://ikiwiki.info/setup/) for more customization options. Your new ikiwiki blog is now ready! 

If you want to run our copy of the blog, grab our open sourced version

Then change the *srcdir* setting in your ikiwiki blog setup file (~/blog.setup) to ~/coderfly-blog.setup. Then run

    cd coderfly-blog.setup
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:ramseydsilva/blog.git
