This blog is powered by [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) and hosted on github. The reason I chose ikiwiki is because it is lightweight, customizable, and coder friendly. There are two ways to add new posts. One is through its simple and stripped down web interface. The second is via a code editor such as vim. All you need to do is create a new markdown file for your post and run the setup command to publish your new post. It integrates the blogging experience into your beloved code editors (mine is [vim](http://www.vim.org/)). Unlike other blogging softwares that are locked into web browsers, ikiwiki makes blogging possible from your terminal window - making it truly a coders blog.

To install your own ikiwiki blog, follow the installation instructions on ikiwiki's [installation](http://ikiwiki.info/install/) page. Then run the following command to setup your blog:

    ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto-blog.setup
    Successfully set up blog:
	    url:         http://Ubuntu-1210-quantal-64-minimal/~coderfly/blog
	    srcdir:      ~/blog
	    destdir:     ~/public_html/blog
	    repository:  ~/blog.git
    To modify settings, edit ~/blog.setup and then run:
	    ikiwiki -setup ~/blog.setup

See [setup](http://ikiwiki.info/setup/) for more customization options. Your new ikiwiki blog is now ready! 

If you want to run our copy of the blog, grab our open sourced version

    git clone git@github.com:ramseydsilva/blog.git ~/coderfly-blog

Then change the *srcdir* setting in your ikiwiki blog setup file (~/blog.setup) to ~/coderfly-blog and run

    cd coderfly-blog
    git remote set-url --add origin git@github.com:ramseydsilva/blog.git
    ikiwiki --setup ~/blog.setup

Now you should be able to see all the posts we have on our blog on your local cloned repo and your locally hosted coderfly blog. Although you won't be able to push to our repository, you can pull updates at any time. You will notice that this blog is fairly new. We will customize our layout and features in the coming days... stay tuned!
