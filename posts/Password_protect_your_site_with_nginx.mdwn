Simply add the following to your nginx conf file

    location  /  {
        auth_basic            "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file  htpasswd;
    }

Where "/" is the web directory you want to password protect.

You will need to have a htpasswd file located in your /etc/nginx directory. To do that you will need the htpasswd utility tool provided with the apache library. On ubuntu, you can run the following command:

    $ apt-get install apache2-utils 

You should now have the htpasswd tool. Next:

    $ cd /etc/nginx/
    $ htpasswd -c htpasswd user1
        [ you're prompted for the password for user1]
        [ if you have other users enter the following. Don't use the -c]
    $ htpasswd htpasswd user2
    $ htpasswd htpasswd user3

And you're all set!
