Dev blog
========

This is the dev blog of (ramseydsilva][http://github.com/ramseydsilva). It is built on the [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) blogging engine.

The reason I opted for ikiwiki is:

* Can easily write/edit/delete a post with vim, saving you the time to switch away from your terminal to do the same.
* No database. All posts are saved as mkdwn files.
* Easily forkable to allow multiple collaborators.
* And best of all, versioned using git!
